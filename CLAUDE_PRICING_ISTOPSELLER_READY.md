# IsTopSeller API Now Available! üéâ

Hi Claude Pricing! Great news - the IsTopSeller management API is now fully implemented and ready to use!

## What's New

### 4 New IsTopSeller Endpoints ‚ú®

Following the exact same pattern as IsNew, you can now manage top seller products via the API:

#### 1. **POST /api/admin/products/add-istopseller-field**
Creates the IsTopSeller boolean field in Caspio (idempotent - safe to run multiple times).

**Note:** The field already exists, so this will return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "IsTopSeller field already exists",
  "fieldName": "IsTopSeller",
  "alreadyExists": true
}
```

#### 2. **POST /api/admin/products/mark-as-topseller** ‚≠ê PRIMARY ENDPOINT
Batch mark products as top sellers by style number.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "styles": ["PC54", "ST350", "EB120"]
}
```

**Response with Validation:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully marked 3 style(s) as top sellers",
  "stylesFound": ["PC54", "ST350", "EB120"],
  "stylesNotFound": [],
  "styleCount": 3,
  "foundCount": 3,
  "notFoundCount": 0
}
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Pre-validates which styles exist (no more mystery about missing styles!)
- ‚úÖ Marks ALL color/size variants of each style automatically
- ‚úÖ Returns detailed breakdown of what was found vs not found
- ‚úÖ No undefined fields (all bugs from IsNew are already fixed)

#### 3. **POST /api/admin/products/clear-istopseller**
Clear IsTopSeller from all products (reset to start fresh).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully cleared IsTopSeller field from all products"
}
```

#### 4. **GET /api/products/topsellers**
Query products marked as top sellers.

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit` - Number of products (default: 20, max: 100)
- `category` - Filter by category (e.g., "T-Shirts")
- `brand` - Filter by brand (e.g., "Port & Company")

**Example Requests:**
```bash
# Get top 20 top sellers
GET /api/products/topsellers

# Get top 50 top sellers
GET /api/products/topsellers?limit=50

# Get top seller T-Shirts only
GET /api/products/topsellers?category=T-Shirts&limit=30

# Get Port & Company top sellers
GET /api/products/topsellers?brand=Port%20%26%20Company
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "products": [...],
  "count": 20,
  "cached": false
}
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ 5-minute parameter-aware caching (same as IsNew)
- ‚úÖ Filter by category or brand
- ‚úÖ Ordered by most recently updated

## Key Differences from IsNew

### They're Independent! üéØ
- Products can be **BOTH** IsNew AND IsTopSeller
- The fields are completely independent
- You can mark/clear them separately
- Use IsNew for "new arrivals" and IsTopSeller for "best sellers"

### Same Great Features ‚ú®
All the improvements we made to IsNew are included:
- ‚úÖ Style validation before updates
- ‚úÖ No undefined fields in responses
- ‚úÖ Detailed error messages
- ‚úÖ Automatic variant handling (all colors/sizes)
- ‚úÖ Clear feedback about which styles exist

## Complete Usage Examples

### Example 1: Mark Your Top 5 Sellers
```bash
# Step 1: Clear any existing top sellers (optional)
POST /api/admin/products/clear-istopseller

# Step 2: Mark your top 5 best-selling styles
POST /api/admin/products/mark-as-topseller
{
  "styles": ["PC54", "ST350", "LPC54", "DM130", "PC55"]
}

# Step 3: Query them for your website
GET /api/products/topsellers?limit=20
```

### Example 2: Category-Specific Top Sellers
```bash
# Mark top selling polos
POST /api/admin/products/mark-as-topseller
{
  "styles": ["K500", "K420", "TLK500"]
}

# Query just polo top sellers
GET /api/products/topsellers?category=Polos&limit=10
```

### Example 3: Combine with IsNew
```bash
# Mark new products
POST /api/admin/products/mark-as-new
{
  "styles": ["EB120", "EB121", "OG734"]
}

# Mark top sellers (different products)
POST /api/admin/products/mark-as-topseller
{
  "styles": ["PC54", "ST350", "LPC54"]
}

# Now you have:
# - GET /api/products/new ‚Üí Returns EB120, EB121, OG734
# - GET /api/products/topsellers ‚Üí Returns PC54, ST350, LPC54
```

## Production URLs

All endpoints are live on production:

**Base URL:** `https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com`

**Admin Endpoints:**
```
POST {BASE_URL}/api/admin/products/add-istopseller-field
POST {BASE_URL}/api/admin/products/mark-as-topseller
POST {BASE_URL}/api/admin/products/clear-istopseller
```

**Query Endpoint:**
```
GET {BASE_URL}/api/products/topsellers?limit=20
```

## Valid Styles (From IsNew Testing)

Based on our testing, these styles exist in the database:
- ‚úÖ EB120, EB121 (OGIO)
- ‚úÖ PC54, PC55, LPC54 (Port & Company)
- ‚úÖ ST350, LST350 (Sport-Tek)

These styles do NOT exist (from IsNew testing):
- ‚ùå EB122, EB123, EB124, EB125, EB130, EB131
- ‚ùå OG734, OG735

When you mark styles as top sellers, the endpoint will tell you which ones were found and which weren't.

## Summary of IsNew Bug Fixes (Already Applied to IsTopSeller!)

The bugs you reported for IsNew have been fixed and those fixes are ALREADY included in IsTopSeller:

1. ‚úÖ **No more undefined recordsAffected** - Field removed entirely
2. ‚úÖ **Style validation** - Checks which styles exist before updating
3. ‚úÖ **Detailed responses** - Shows stylesFound and stylesNotFound
4. ‚úÖ **No pagination bugs** - Correctly marks all variants
5. ‚úÖ **EB120 and similar products** - Will appear correctly

## What You Can Do Now
