# Quote Items POST Endpoint Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
- **Date**: December 4, 2024
- **Branch**: `fix-quote-POST-/api/quote_items`
- **Deployment**: Heroku v109

## Problem
The POST `/api/quote_items` endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error with the message:
```
Invalid column name 'ItemID'
Cannot perform operation because the following field(s) do not exist: 'ItemID'
```

## Root Cause
The server code was attempting to insert an `ItemID` field that no longer existed in the Caspio Quote_Items table. The user had previously removed this autonumber field because Caspio tables cannot have multiple autonumber fields, and they needed the PK_ID field to be the primary autonumber.

## Solution
Removed all references to the ItemID field from the server.js file:

1. **POST `/api/quote_items` endpoint** (lines 4195-4343):
   - Removed ItemID from request body destructuring
   - Removed ItemID generation logic
   - Removed ItemID from the recordData object sent to Caspio

2. **PUT `/api/quote_items/:id` endpoint**:
   - Removed ItemID from request body destructuring
   - Removed ItemID from the updateData object

## Testing Results
After deployment, the POST endpoint now works correctly:
- Successfully creates quote items without ItemID field
- Returns 201 status code
- No more "Invalid column name" errors

## Test Command
You can now use your original curl command successfully:
```bash
curl -X POST https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/quote_items \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

```

## Next Steps

2. The Quote_Items endpoints are now fully functional
3. No further changes needed for the ItemID issue
