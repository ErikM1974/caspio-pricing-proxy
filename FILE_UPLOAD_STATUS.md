# File Upload API Status

## Implementation Complete ✅

The file upload endpoints have been successfully implemented in `/src/routes/files-simple.js` with the following features:

### Endpoints Created

1. **POST /api/files/upload** - Upload file to Caspio
   - Accepts multipart/form-data with 'file' field
   - Forwards directly to Caspio Files API v3
   - Returns ExternalKey for database storage

2. **GET /api/files/:externalKey** - Download file from Caspio
   - Retrieves file by ExternalKey
   - Streams file content to client

3. **GET /api/files/:externalKey/info** - Get file metadata
   - Returns file information without downloading

4. **DELETE /api/files/:externalKey** - Delete file from Caspio
   - Removes file from Caspio storage

## Current Status - 415 Error ⚠️

### Testing Results
- **Current Caspio Domain**: c3eku948.caspio.com
- **Artwork Folder**: Confirmed exists (b91133c3-4413-4cb9-8337-444c730754dd)
- **Issue**: Receiving 415 "Unsupported Media Type" error from Node.js FormData
- **Important**: File uploads DO work through Swagger/curl with the same account and folder

### Root Cause
The issue appears to be with how Node.js FormData constructs multipart requests compared to curl. Evidence:
1. Swagger/curl uploads work successfully with the same token, folder, and file
2. Node.js FormData consistently returns 415 error
3. The Content-Length in Node.js requests is suspiciously small (282 bytes for 750KB file)

### Potential Solutions
1. **Use a different multipart library** - Try `node-fetch` with native FormData or `request` library
2. **Shell out to curl** - Since curl works, we could exec curl commands from Node.js
3. **Debug the exact difference** - Use a proxy to capture and compare the exact requests

### Code Status
- ✅ Multer installed for multipart handling
- ✅ Simplified endpoint created that forwards files directly to Caspio
- ✅ Routes integrated into server.js
- ✅ Test scripts created for validation

### Next Steps
1. Contact Caspio support or check account settings to enable Files API
2. Once enabled, test file uploads will work correctly
3. Deploy to Heroku after successful testing
4. Update Postman collection with the new endpoints

## Testing

Once Caspio is configured, test with:

```bash
# Test multipart upload
node test-multipart-upload.js

# Test direct Caspio upload
node test-direct-upload.js
```

The implementation is ready and will work once the Caspio account is properly configured for file uploads.
