## üö® Issue: Two Products Not Appearing in /api/products/new Results

We successfully marked 15 products as "new" using your `/api/admin/products/mark-as-new` endpoint, but **2 of 15 products are not showing up** in the `/api/products/new` query results.

### Successfully Marked (13 of 15):
‚úÖ EB121, CT100617, CT103828, CT104670, DT620, DT624, NE410, ST850, ST851, BB18200, CS410, CS415, EB201

### Missing from Results (2 of 15):
‚ùå **EB120** - Eddie Bauer Adventurer 1/4-Zip
‚ùå **CT104597** - Carhartt Watch Cap 2.0

---

## üîç Investigation Results

### What We Verified

**Both products exist in the database:**
```bash
# EB120 via /api/product-details
curl -s "https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/product-details?styleNumber=EB120"
# Returns 21 color/size variants, all with PRODUCT_STATUS: "New"

# CT104597 via /api/products/search
curl -s "https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/products/search?q=CT104597"
# Returns 1 variant with PRODUCT_STATUS: "New"
```

**Both products were successfully marked:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/admin/products/mark-as-new \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"styles": ["EB120", "CT104597"]}'

# Response: {"success":true,"message":"Successfully marked undefined records as new","styles":["EB120","CT104597"],"styleCount":2}
```

**But they don't appear in query results:**
```bash
curl -s "https://caspio-pricing-proxy-ab30a049961a.herokuapp.com/api/products/new?limit=2000"
# Returns 1221 products total
# EB120: NOT in results
# CT104597: NOT in results
```

### What Makes This Strange

1. **Same product status** - Both have `PRODUCT_STATUS: "New"` (capital N), same as the 13 successful products
2. **API returned success** - The mark-as-new endpoint reported successful updates for both
3. **Products definitely exist** - They show up in product-details and search endpoints
4. **Not a cache issue** - Waited for cache to clear (5-minute TTL), still missing
5. **Not a limit issue** - Query returns 1221 products, so we're not hitting the 2000 limit

## ü§î Possible Causes to Investigate

### Theory 1: WHERE Clause Filter
The `/api/products/new` endpoint might have additional filters that exclude these products:

```sql
-- Example query that might be excluding them:
SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE IsNew = true
  AND PRODUCT_STATUS = 'Active'  -- EB120/CT104597 have status 'New', not 'Active'
  AND CATEGORY_NAME IS NOT NULL  -- They might have empty categories
  AND BRAND_NAME IN (...)         -- They might not be in brand whitelist
```

**Check:** Does the query filter by `PRODUCT_STATUS = 'Active'`? If so, products with status "New" (like EB120) would be excluded even if they have `IsNew=true`.

### Theory 2: IsNew Field Not Actually Updated
The mark-as-new endpoint returned success, but maybe the database update didn't persist:

```javascript
// Check in Caspio directly:
// Does EB120 actually have IsNew=true in the database?
// Or did the update fail silently?
```

**Evidence:** The `/api/product-details` endpoint doesn't return the `IsNew` field at all (shows `undefined`), while `/api/products/new` does include it. This suggests different queries/tables.

### Theory 3: Different Tables/Views
The two endpoints might query different tables or views:

- `/api/product-details` - Queries one table (doesn't include IsNew field)
- `/api/products/new` - Queries different table or view (includes IsNew field)

If they're separate tables, maybe the update only hit one of them?

### Theory 4: Compound Primary Key Issue
The mark-as-new endpoint searches by `STYLE` field, but maybe these products require a compound key (STYLE + COLOR + SIZE)?

```javascript
// Current update logic (guessing):
UPDATE Products SET IsNew = true WHERE STYLE = 'EB120'

// Maybe it needs to update specific PK_IDs instead?
UPDATE Products SET IsNew = true WHERE PK_ID IN (...)
```

## üìã Recommended Debug Steps

1. **Check the WHERE clause** in `/api/products/new` endpoint:
   - Does it filter by `PRODUCT_STATUS = 'Active'`?
   - Any other filters that might exclude EB120/CT104597?

2. **Verify database updates** happened:
   - Query Caspio directly: Does EB120 have `IsNew=true` in the database?
   - Check the SQL UPDATE statement logs

3. **Compare successful vs failed products**:
   - What's different about EB120/CT104597?
   - Category? Brand? Status? Some other field?

4. **Check if product-details should include IsNew**:
   - Currently it returns `IsNew: undefined`
   - Should it be included in the SELECT statement?

5. **Test with a known-working product**:
   ```bash
   # Unmark EB121 (which works), then re-mark it
   # See if it shows up immediately or has the same delay
   ```

## üÜï Feature Request: IsTopSeller Field

**Question:** Do we need the ability to mark products as "top sellers" similar to the IsNew functionality?

### Proposed Endpoints

Following the same pattern as IsNew:

```
POST /api/admin/products/add-istopseller-field
# One-time setup to create the field

POST /api/admin/products/mark-as-top-seller
{
  "styles": ["PC54", "ST350", "DT6000"],
  "isTopSeller": true
}

GET /api/products/top-sellers?limit=20
# Query products where IsTopSeller = true
```

### Use Case

We have a CSV of top-selling products (similar to the new products CSV) that we'd like to:
1. Mark in the database with `IsTopSeller=true`
2. Query via API endpoint
3. Display on a "Best Sellers" showcase page

### Questions

1. **Should we implement IsTopSeller functionality?**
   - Same pattern as IsNew (field creation, batch marking, query endpoint)
   - Would use the same architecture you built

2. **Can products be both IsNew AND IsTopSeller?**
   - Or should they be mutually exclusive?
   - How should the showcase page handle products that are both?

3. **Should IsTopSeller have a time limit?**
   - IsNew might expire after 90 days
   - Should IsTopSeller be permanent until manually unmarked?
   - Or should it auto-expire based on sales data?

## üìä Current Status Summary

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Field creation endpoint works
- Batch marking endpoint returns success
- Query endpoint returns results with proper caching
- 13 of 15 products showing correctly

### What's Not Working ‚ùå
- EB120 marked successfully but not in query results
- CT104597 marked successfully but not in query results
- IsNew field not visible in /api/product-details responses

### What We Need ü§î
- Investigation into why 2 products aren't showing
- Clarity on IsTopSeller feature request
- Understanding of the product-details vs products/new query differences
