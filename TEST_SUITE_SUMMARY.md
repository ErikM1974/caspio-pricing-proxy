# Endpoint Testing Suite Summary

## Test Applications Created

### 1. **test-all-endpoints.js** (Comprehensive)
- Tests all endpoint categories systematically
- Includes performance metrics and detailed reporting
- Groups endpoints by functionality
- Provides pass/fail statistics by category
- Shows response times and data sizes

### 2. **test-endpoints-quick.js** (Quick Test)
- Lightweight testing for rapid verification
- Tests core endpoints with simple queries
- Avoids heavy inventory queries that timeout
- Good for quick server health checks

### 3. **test-all-actual-endpoints.js** (Complete)
- Tests ALL 50+ endpoints found in server.js
- Organized by functional categories
- Provides the most accurate assessment
- Best for comprehensive server validation

### 4. **test-refactored-server.js** (Original)
- Simple endpoint tester
- Good for basic functionality checks

## How to Use

### Quick Server Test
```bash
# Start server
node start-server.js

# Run quick test (recommended for daily use)
node test-endpoints-quick.js
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Start server
node start-server.js

# Run complete endpoint test
node test-all-actual-endpoints.js
```

### Test Results Interpretation

✅ **Working Endpoints** (Confirmed):
- System health endpoints
- Pricing APIs (tiers, costs, rules)
- Product search and details
- Inventory and size information
- Utility endpoints (locations, upcharges)

⚠️ **Endpoints Needing Attention**:
- Some product category endpoints return empty results
- Cart, Order, and Quote endpoints (from modular routes not loaded)
- Art requests/invoices (may need data in Caspio)

❌ **Known Issues**:
- Heavy inventory queries can timeout (e.g., PC54 with 45,000+ records)
- Some endpoints return 404 due to missing modular route loading
- Endpoints expecting specific data may fail if Caspio tables are empty

## Server Performance

Based on testing:
- Average response time: 300-400ms for most endpoints
- Health check: ~5-15ms
- Database queries: 300-600ms
- Heavy queries: Can exceed 10s timeout

## Recommendations

1. **For Development**: Use `test-endpoints-quick.js` for rapid iteration
2. **For Validation**: Use `test-all-actual-endpoints.js` for complete coverage
3. **For Production**: Consider adding the missing modular endpoints as needed
4. **For Performance**: Add pagination limits to heavy queries

## Available Test Commands

# Quick restart and test
./restart-server.sh && node test-endpoints-quick.js

# Full test suite
node start-server.js && node test-all-actual-endpoints.js

# Specific endpoint test
