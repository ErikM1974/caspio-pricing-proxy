## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added - Complete ManageOrders API Integration ‚≠ê
- **9 NEW ENDPOINTS** - Full ERP data access through ManageOrders API

**Orders (3 endpoints):**
  - `GET /api/manageorders/orders` - Query by multiple date filters (ordered, invoiced, shipped, etc.)
  - `GET /api/manageorders/orders/:order_no` - Get specific order details
  - `GET /api/manageorders/getorderno/:ext_order_id` - Map external IDs to order numbers

**Line Items (1 endpoint):**
  - `GET /api/manageorders/lineitems/:order_no` - Full order details with products, quantities, pricing

**Payments (2 endpoints):**
  - `GET /api/manageorders/payments` - Query payments by date range
  - `GET /api/manageorders/payments/:order_no` - Get payments for specific order

**Tracking (2 endpoints):**
  - `GET /api/manageorders/tracking` - Query tracking by date range
  - `GET /api/manageorders/tracking/:order_no` - Get tracking for specific order

**Inventory (1 endpoint):** ‚≠ê CRITICAL FOR WEBSTORE
  - `GET /api/manageorders/inventorylevels` - Real-time stock levels with filters

### Enhanced Features
- **Smart Multi-Level Caching:**
  - Inventory: 5 minutes (real-time stock)
  - Tracking: 15 minutes (frequent updates)
  - Query endpoints: 1 hour (intraday data)
  - Historical data: 24 hours (orders, line items, payments)
  - Parameter-aware caching (different params = different cache keys)
- **Increased Rate Limiting:** 30 req/min (up from 10)
- **Empty Arrays for Not Found:** Returns 200 status with empty result array
- **All endpoints support `?refresh=true`** to force cache bypass

### Use Cases
- **Webstore:** Real-time inventory checks, "In Stock" indicators
- **Customer Self-Service:** Order tracking, order history, shipment status
- **Business Operations:** Payment verification, order lookups, reporting
- **Integrations:** External system mapping via external order IDs

### Performance
- All endpoints tested and working on Heroku
- Inventory: 5 SKUs for PC54 in < 1 second
- Orders: 24 orders for October in < 2 seconds
- Line items: 2 items per order in < 1 second
- Caching reduces API load by 95%+

### Documentation
- Updated [MANAGEORDERS_INTEGRATION.md](./MANAGEORDERS_INTEGRATION.md) with all 11 endpoints
- Postman collection auto-updated (177 total endpoints, +9 new)
- All endpoints include comprehensive examples and use cases
