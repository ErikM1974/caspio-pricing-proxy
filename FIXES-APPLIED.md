# Fixes Applied to Resolve 503 Errors

## Date: May 26, 2025

### Problem
The `/api/color-swatches` endpoint and other endpoints were returning 503 Service Unavailable errors on Heroku.

### Root Cause
The Caspio API was responding slowly, causing timeouts that exceeded Heroku's 30-second request limit. The application was trying to fetch too much data without proper timeout handling.

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Optimized Timeout Handling**
   - Reduced per-request timeout from 15s to 10s
   - Added total timeout of 25s for entire pagination process
   - Implemented graceful timeout handling to continue with collected data

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added try-catch blocks around individual page requests
   - Continue processing with partial data on timeout
   - Return collected results instead of throwing errors

3. **Memory Optimization**
   - Process and deduplicate colors as they're collected
   - Early exit when sufficient data is collected
   - Reduced page size to 50 records for color swatches

4. **Code Changes in `server.js`**
   ```javascript
   // Added total timeout check
   const checkTotalTimeout = () => {
       if (Date.now() - startTime > mergedOptions.totalTimeout) {
           console.log(`Total timeout reached for ${resourcePath}`);
           return true;
       }
       return false;
   };

   // Added per-page error handling
   try {
       const response = await axios(config);
       // ... process response
   } catch (pageError) {
       if (pageError.code === 'ECONNABORTED' || pageError.message.includes('timeout')) {
           console.log(`Timeout on page ${pageCount}, continuing with collected data`);
           morePages = false;
       } else {
           throw pageError;
       }
   }
   ```

### Results
- ✅ 503 errors eliminated
- ✅ Endpoints now return partial data on timeout instead of failing
- ✅ Color swatches endpoint returns 6 colors successfully
- ✅ All major endpoints are functional
- ✅ Average response time improved

### Remaining Considerations
- Caspio API performance is the bottleneck
- Some endpoints may return partial data during high load
- Consider implementing Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Monitor Caspio API response times

### Deployment
All fixes have been deployed to Heroku production environment.
